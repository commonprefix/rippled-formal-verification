/-! # Withdraw exit reductions

Code inventories for the two exchange computations (`computeWithdrawByAssets`,
`computeWithdrawByShares`) and the full `LawfulVault.withdraw` walk behind
`withdraw_error_codes`. The walks use `bind_ok_peel`, `if`-elimination, and the
`tryCatch` step lemmas only, keeping the `checked`/`ofNumber` pipeline opaque. -/
