/-! # Guard-extraction reductions for `Vault.withdraw`

The accuracy proofs need to recover, from a successful run
(`v.withdraw … = .ok r` with `r.error = none`), every intermediate the success
record was built from. This file provides that walk for the withdraw pipeline:
the two exchange helpers (`sharesToAssetsWithdraw`, `assetsToSharesWithdraw`),
the two `computeWithdrawBy*` wrappers (whose `try`/`catch` handler can only
produce error codes), and `Vault.withdraw` itself, split into its final and
non-final success exits.

The walk uses only `bind_ok_peel` and `if`-elimination, so every heavy step
stays an opaque `.ok` witness and the well-founded `Number` pipeline is never
forced. -/
