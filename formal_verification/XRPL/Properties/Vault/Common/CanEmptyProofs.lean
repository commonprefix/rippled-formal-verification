/-! # `CanEmpty`: every reachable loss-free vault can be emptied

Proof bodies for the `CanEmpty` headline in `CanEmpty.lean`.

The construction peels one share per withdrawal, driven by well-founded
induction on the stored share total `v.toExact.sharesTotal` (a `ℕ`). A single
share withdrawal always runs to a success that strictly lowers the share total:

* a share count of at least two prices to at most half the net asset value, so
  the funds guard has ample margin and cannot fire, and the run is not the final
  withdrawal, so the stored share total drops by exactly one; and
* if that payout is below the representable floor it rounds to zero, which the
  precision-loss guard does not reject (that guard needs a nonzero payout), so
  the share is burned for free and the total still drops.

The share total therefore strictly decreases every step and the recursion
bottoms out at zero shares, the empty state.

The single arithmetic crux, that the one-share run reduces to a success record
whose stored share total is strictly smaller, is isolated as
`withdraw_one_share_step`; everything else (reachability closure, the share-domain
bound, and the induction) is discharged around it. -/

/-- Reachability, a share total that fits the `int64` domain, the asset
representability rail, and the `int64` asset-type scope. Kept as one predicate so
the closure and the induction thread the same facts.

`assetsCap` is the representability guarantee C++ enforces at `accountSend` (the
asset can never exceed the asset type's max): `LawfulVault.Reachable` over-approximates
here, admitting integral-donation histories whose `assetsTotal` exceeds
`numericType.maxValue` (C++ rejects them, the model omits that rail), so without
this hypothesis the one-share pricing `nav * 1 / sharesTotal` can overflow and the
withdrawal fails. It is preserved along the peeling sequence because a withdrawal
only decreases `assetsTotal` (`withdraw_oneShare_assetsTotal_le`).

`int64` restricts the scope to `int64`-typed (integral) asset vaults. This is
NECESSARY, not cosmetic: on a fractional vault the one-share payout can be smaller
than one ULP of the stored `assetsTotal`, so the (waiting-the-C++-fix)
precision-loss guard rejects the withdrawal with `tecPRECISION_LOSS`. A concrete
reachable fractional counterexample is `create .fractional` then a single deposit
of `10 ^ 17`: the one-share redemption is rejected, so one-share peeling does not
empty it. On an `int64` vault the payout is a whole unit and always lowers the
rounded total, so the guard never fires.

`assetsInt` records that the stored `assetsTotal` is a whole number. It is a true
invariant of `int64` vaults (every operation stores an integer difference), stated
here rather than derived from `LawfulVault.Reachable` because that derivation is a
separate reachability induction outside the one-share pricing argument. It is
preserved along the peeling sequence (a whole `assetsTotal` minus a whole payout is
whole), and it supplies the magnitude floor `1 ≤ assetsTotal.toRat` (when nonzero)
that discharges the multiply operand bound `minExponent ≤ assetsTotal.exponent_`. -/

nonnegative `Number` whose value fits `2 ^ 63 - 1` has a nonpositive exponent: its

`10 ^ 19 > 2 ^ 63 - 1`. This is the bridge from the `assetsTotal` representability
rail to the front-half overflow preconditions. -/

/-- **The one-share withdrawal on an `int64` vault runs to a no-error success.** On
a reachable `int64`-asset vault with at least one share, a whole-number
`assetsTotal`, and both totals within `2 ^ 63 - 1`, the one-share withdrawal
returns `.ok r` with `r.error = none`.

The pricing prefix is total (`withdraw_oneShare_exchange`): the exchange returns a
priced `assets` at most `assetsTotal`, and the payout `toNumber` lift `aN` is
normalized and integer-valued. The `try`/`catch` wrapper forwards it
(`withdraw_oneShare_compute_of_exchange`), so the run reaches a success record.

Every guard is escaped:
* the funds guard cannot fire, since the payout is at most
  `assetsTotal = assetsAvailable` (`operator_lt_iff`);
* the share total conversion `ofNumber .int64 sharesTotal` is total
  (`ofNumber_int64_ok`);
* on the final exit (whole share total, `sharesTotal = 1`) the zero unrealized
  loss clears the `tefINTERNAL` guard and `ofNumber .int64 assetsAvailable` is
  total;
* on the non-final exit the stored decrements are total `operator_sub`s
  (`operator_sub_ok_of_normalized_cap`), and the precision-loss guard is escaped by
  the whole-unit dichotomy: a zero-mantissa payout skips the guard, and a nonzero
  (hence `≥ 1`) payout lowers the whole rounded `assetsTotal`, so the two rounded
  totals differ.

The `int64` scope is necessary; the statement is false for fractional vaults, where
a sub-ULP one-share payout trips the precision-loss guard (see `LawfulVault.EmptyReady`).

/-- **The arithmetic crux (single blocking lemma).** On a reachable, loss-free
vault with at least one share, withdrawing exactly one share runs to a success
record whose stored share total is strictly smaller.

The proof splits on the run's final / non-final branch (exposed by
`withdraw_success_reduces`). A final withdrawal zeroes the vault, dropping the
stored total to zero. A non-final withdrawal burns exactly one share
(`withdraw_sharesBurned_exact`), so `withdraw_vault_updates` stores
`sharesTotal - 1`, which is strictly smaller than `sharesTotal ≥ 1`. Both branches
therefore strictly lower the stored total.

The one remaining input, that the one-share run reaches a success record at all
(no throw, no rejecting `TER`), is isolated as `withdraw_oneShare_run_ok`. -/
